 *
 * Description:
 *  Given an array of integers, every element appears three times except for one, which appears
 *  exactly once. Find that single one.
 *
 * Note:
 *  Your algorithm should have a linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it without using
 *  extra memory?
 *
 * Complexity:
 *  Time: _O(n)_
 *  Space: _O(1)_
